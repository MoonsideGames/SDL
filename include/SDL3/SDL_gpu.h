/* Render pass structures */

/* These structures define how textures will be read/written in a render pass.
 *
 * loadOp: Determines what is done with the texture slice at the beginning of the render pass.
 *
 *   LOAD:
 *     Loads the data currently in the texture slice.
 *
 *   CLEAR:
 *     Clears the texture slice to a single color.
 *
 *   DONT_CARE:
 *     The driver will do whatever it wants with the texture slice memory.
 *     This is a good option if you know that every single pixel will be touched in the render pass.
 *
 * storeOp: Determines what is done with the texture slice at the end of the render pass.
 *
 *   STORE:
 *     Stores the results of the render pass in the texture slice.
 *
 *   DONT_CARE:
 *     The driver will do whatever it wants with the texture slice memory.
 *     This is often a good option for depth/stencil textures.
 *
 *
 * writeOption is ignored if loadOp is LOAD and is implicitly assumed to be SAFE.
 * Interleaving LOAD and CYCLE successively on the same texture (not slice!) is undefined behavior.
 *
 * writeOption:
 *  CYCLE:
 *    If this texture slice has been used in commands that have not completed,
 *    the implementation may choose to prevent a data dependency at the cost of increased memory usage.
 *    You may NOT assume that any of the previous texture data is retained.
 *    This may prevent stalls when frequently reusing a texture slice in rendering.
 *
 *  UNSAFE:
 *    Overwrites the data unsafely. You must ensure that data used by earlier draw calls
 *    is not affected or visual corruption can occur.
 *
 *  SAFE:
 *    Overwrites the data safely. Earlier draw calls will not be affected.
 *    This is usually the slowest option.
